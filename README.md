# Recipe Radar

Recipe Radar is a React Native app that suggests recipes to you based on the items you have in your fridge/pantry. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwWnqkhe4jY) to see a video demo.

## How It Works

After buying groceries, you can use our app to take a photo of your receipt. The app will parse out the items in your receipt and save them to Google FireStore. It will then recommend recipes you can make based on the ingredients you have. You can always manage your list of ingredients using the app's interface.

## How We Built It

The front-end was built using React Native. It uses `axios` to query the recipe API and uses Google Firebase to store the user's list of ingredients.

On the back-end, we have a Flask server that receives the recipe image from the front-end through `ngrok`. It then sends the image of the receipt to Google Cloud Vision to get the text extracted. We then post-process the data we receive to filter out any unwanted noise.

## Challenges We Ran Into

One of the challenges we ran into was deploying our Flask server to Google App Engine. We found that it was not possible to write into Google App Engine storage; instead, we had to write into Firestore and have that interact with Google App Engine.

On the frontend, we had trouble designing the UI to be responsive across platforms, especially since we were relatively inexperienced with React Native development. We also had trouble finding a recipe API that suited our needs and had sufficient documentation.

## How to Run
```
git clone https://github.com/AndyJiang99/HackWestern2019
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start Flask Server

```
python server.py
copy ngrok endpoint to camera.js
```

Start react-native application

```
expo start
```

Download the expo app on your mobile device and scan the QR code generated by `expo start`.
